## KNN
A collection of parallelizations of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, built with MPI, Java Spark, MapReduce, and MASS. Completed in collaboration with Matthew Woerner (principle author of the MPI code), and Boyan Hristov (principle author of the MapReduce code). As that code was not principly produced by myself, I have not included it in this directory.
